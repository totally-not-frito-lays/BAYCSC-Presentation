I'm Ryan

notes: Hello there, I'm Ryan! I'm a new grad from UC San Diego and I'm here to talk about the incredible and unexpected journey that was college.. at least from my point of view.

# Timeline:
1. My Lore
2. My Journey
3. My Advice

notes:
We'll start with a little bit of background as to who I am and what I'm motivated by. Then we'll jump into what did I do. Then drop some sagely advice.

---
Academically I'm...
- a new grad 
- majored in computer science
- almost two minors*
- not an amazing student (2.8 GPA)

---
Out of the classroom I'm ...
- a star wars nerd
- a volunteer in CS education
- an amateur photographer
- a wannabe athlete

---
Professionally I'm...
- a leader
	- President of a club
	- Hackathon director

For context, I grew up in the small town of Julian, CA
- 20 students in my class
- 20 miles from the nearest mcdonalds
- non-challenging academics

notes:
The town is small enough that other school's cross country teams would outnumber my school. So as you might imagine, we didn't have computer science, no AP STEM classes, no STEM clubs. The preparation for college was rough for me.

---
I wanted to be an engineer
![tony stark | 700](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bc/ea/7f/bcea7f4818bb16e179a2f5eca26b6492.jpg)

notes: But I knew what I wanted. I wanted to become an engineer. I wanted to solve problems. I wanted to make super cool stuff. I wanted to make science fiction, science non-fiction. 

So I started a robotics club, thus kicking off my journey of lifting up others to pursue engineering and eventually, my trajectory towards CS education.

---
Enough lore, what did I do in the last 4 years???

---

> Year 1 - Exploration

notes: everything I could do, I did. Not very well but I tried.

---
![[Pasted image 20231021104655.png|700]]
notes: very first day of class, it was packed. each lecture hall can fit around 300 people, that's 3 times the size of my school. you could say that I had a bit of culture shock

---
![[Pasted image 20231021124058.png|700]]
notes: my dorm looked like this. on the left is all the flyers of every club I tried to join. turns out when you join every club, you don't have time to do anything in any club

---
 ![[Pasted image 20231021101555.png|700]]  ![[Pasted image 20231021124020.png|700]]
 notes: I also attended every event that I could. Career fairs, intern panels, and even a hackathon.

---
![[Pasted image 20231021123958.png|700]]
notes: 
As a side effect of doing everything. I snagged a lotta swag 

---
![[Pasted image 20231021125337.png|700]]
![[Pasted image 20231021123042.png]]
notes: I also made sure to keep being myself. A healthy amount of shenanigans. Learning the uke. Drawing in my spare time. It helped when I had an identity crisis a couple months in, not feeling as happy as I could be.

# Explore

| Do                                            | Why        |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Join clubs that you vibe with                 | People are everything |
| Use University resources to get academic help | Cheating is not a good use of your money           |
| Become a swag goblin                          |         Free stuff        |
| Continue doing your hobbies                   |           Identity crisis      |

notes:
Your first year, should be your year of exploration. Meet people. Join a club enjoy the company. Try new things. Use the university resources. Take advantage of the free swag. And remember to continue being yourself. Just because you're in a new place around new people doesn't mean you don't have to become a new person.

> Year 2 - Alma Mater

---
![[Pasted image 20231021103504.png]]
notes:
Then zoom hit and we were all online.

---
![[Pasted image 20231021103846.png]]
notes: so i thought that I would have less distractions, which meant I could take more classes. (hint: don't do it, it sucks)

---
![[Pasted image 20231021103949.png]]

notes: then I actually committed to a club. joined this group that would put on a high school hackathon. I was paired up with a project lead and learned how to build a web app.

---
![[Pasted image 20231021104312.png]]
notes: my social life was rapidly deteriorating but because small school perks, I had the chance to volunteer at my school as a robotics mentor.

# Learn
| Do                                                | Why                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Join clubs where you can enjoy learning                    | Near future peers                                  |
| You can audit classes (above your level too)      | Not every class is worth suffering for              |
| Start working on projects of any kind             | Finished fundamentals, start doing something        |
| Apply for internships starting in fall            | There are programs for early college interns (STEP) |

notes:
Key notes. Make sure you actually join a club this time. "Near future peers" refers to people that are in a similar position as you, just one year ahead. This gives you the chance to learn at a level very close to yourself and helps build credibility when you're interested in leadership later down the line. Taking classes is NOT always worth it. For me, I took too many classes and didn't feel like I learned anything because I was learning with shortcuts. If I could go back in time, I would audit those classes which is basically just attending lectures without the work. Also try to start applying for internships. You're not expected to get one, but it's good practice to pitch yourself.

> Year 3 - Leadership + Burnout

---
![[Pasted image 20231021105132.png]]
notes: 
I was off campus and commuted by bike most of the time. Good way to ensure I kept physically active.

---

![[TritonHacks.jpg]] 

notes: I was invited to become the director of the lil hackathon we did last year. Except this time it would be in-person and with a substantially bigger team. But it was a ton of fun and I had a great team.

---
![[Pasted image 20231021105733.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231021105349.png]]
notes:
But then came the burn out. I can get emotionally over-invested at times. In this case, I had the burden of leadership of the hackathon, a year-long effort with over $12000 invested and 150 people involved, then leadership of the organizing body, to manage another 30 members, on top of increasingly difficult classes and the return to in-person learning. My final quarter was quite stressful and I didn't have a good outlet, so my mental health reflected in my grades. I failed a class. Got dumped in my first relationship. Then got hit by a car.

![[Pasted image 20231021105525.png|400]]
notes:
took a while to recover, but I took little wins wherever I could. Joined the star wars club, competed in a lettuce eating competition, and joined a mentorship program. I wish I had joined earlier because I learned so much.

---
![[Pasted image 20231021110739.png]]

notes: oh and I landed my first internship at an athletics esports company where I worked as a backend engineer. I had 3 offers by the end of this hell of a year. One was through a referral where I had training from near-peers, one was through a catered resume / cover letter relevant to my experience, and a final one was from a start up where I had interviewed in the library.

# Build / Lead
| Do                                          | Why                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Look for leadership / senior roles in clubs | Distributed bus factor |
| Learn to cook / eat healthy                 | Maslow's Hierarchy     |
| Find friends with hobbies                   | Accountability + Learn |
|    Internship hunt early                       |   Gives you time to adjust  |
|    Use your calendar                     |          Meetings + Timebox + Regular work sessions               |

notes:
at this stage, make sure you start progressing through clubs. It's no longer good enough to just be a member of everything. Become a leader or responsible for something in your club and start teaching or sharing your lessons. All senior members of any field, needs to learn how to share their wealth of knowledge. Next make sure you learn how to cook and take care of yourself. Hunt for internships early. Then make sure you make good use of your calendar. Here's what a week of my time looked like.

---
![[Pasted image 20231021114319.png]]
notes:
Blue are work sessions. Green are social events. Brown are classes. You've gotta be a wizard to keep track of all this without a calendar.

---
> Year 4 - Payoff

---
![[Pasted image 20231021111051.png]]
notes:
After a summer, I finally relaxed enough to relieve my burnout. I invested more in my club to turn it into a community instead of just a place to work. I got familiar with the entirety of my club's responsibilities. 

---
![[Pasted image 20231021111142.png]]

notes: I would start teaching workshops regularly. This was the core of what we did and I wanted to make sure I was familiar with the core product of our org. I would give feedback on designs. Advise on the next generation of TritonHacks. Represent our organization in recruiting new schools to serve.

---
![[Pasted image 20231021132202.png|700]]
![[Pasted image 20231021111104.png|700]]

notes:
and so I started spending social time with them. really becoming much more extroverted. I wanted to make sure the young'uns of the next generation stick around and have fun in college.

---
![[Pasted image 20231021111417.png|600]]
![[Pasted image 20231021111529.png|600]]
notes:
I also got more invested in the star wars club, eventually acting in a fan film.

---
![[CSE23-giesel-upscaled.gif]]
![[Pasted image 20231021111246.png|600]]
notes:
and rekindled my love for making stuff.

---
![[Pasted image 20231021111706.png]]
notes:
Eventually I would start auditing classes that I could no longer feasibly take. And that led to some incredible opportunities. Led to a tutoring position with the visual arts students and eventually to a spot in a VR research lab. The members of the lab, I actually had met through my club involvement before hand. Because I knew that I wanted to do work in CSEd and I had done work in CSEd, I had the opportunity to keep doing more work in this field.

# Teach and socialize

| Do                                                | Why                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Professor OH for not-school work                  | They're cool people + opportunities |
| Audit classes                                     | VR + Tutor positions                |
| Learn to socialize                                | Opens more opportunities            |
| Don't wait until you're ready to do what you want | Experience begets more experience                                    |

notes:
at this point in time, you're on your way out. Make sure you share your lessons to give back to the people that brought you to where you are today. If you don't need to take the class, consider just auditing them. But most importantly, learn how to socialize. The earlier you do it, the better. But by a senior, this is where you can actually start taking advantage of opportunities by learning how to talk to people. Go to office hours for not-school, go to talk about projects you're interested in. For feedback. For opinions. I had more opportunities back-loaded in my time at UCSD. Maybe it's because I only learned how to talk to people in my final year. Maybe it's because by this stage, I'd been doing what I want to specialize in that I had more opportunities in CSEd.

# Advice time

---

> [!summary] Put everything on GitHub!
![[Pasted image 20231021143635.png]]

notes: 
Not only will it give you those cute lil green marks, it will get you more comfortable with GitHub and make it easier to find old code snippets. Be careful about public class projects.

---
> [!summary] Put experience on LinkedIn
![[Pasted image 20231021144125.png]]

notes: 
this forces you to summarize and quantify the things that you've achieved at each place. Constantly updating gives you consistent reminders to keep working.

# Actionable Advice

---
> [!quote] Start early and start often.

notes: it's an old saying around the CSE department because it has so many levels that are all incredibly valid. 

---
> [!quote] Start early and start often.
  Start homework early
 ![[Pasted image 20231021121518.png]]
 
notes: you can't get help if you haven't started yet. all the advice from near-peers and office hours and advisors can't help if you don't know where you're stuck. To help with this, I recommend you block out like 5 minutes after assignments are revealed to come up with a strategy on how to solve the problem. This allows you to engage your diffused thinking.

---
> [!quote] Start early and start often.
  Prototyping is cheaper
 
notes: in order for you to start often, you've got to come up with new ideas, otherwise you're "repeating often" and that's a recipe for insanity. This subtly encourages innovation. Just pick one thing you want to improve at a time. Don't do a dozen things until you can scale up to a dozen things.

---
> [!quote] Start early and start often.
> Framing around starting, not the stopping
![[Pasted image 20231021122201.png]]

notes: it emphasizes the idea of starting, not stopping. Failure is a consequence of the journey. For every start, there should be some lesson learned regardless of if you failed. That's how we build up to becoming better engineers.
