For context, I grew up in the small town of Julian, CA
- 20 students in my class
- 20 miles from the nearest mcdonalds
- non-challenging academics

notes:
The town is small enough that other school's cross country teams would outnumber my school. So as you might imagine, we didn't have computer science, no AP STEM classes, no STEM clubs. The preparation for college was rough for me.

notes: But I knew what I wanted. I wanted to become an engineer. I wanted to solve problems. I wanted to make super cool stuff. I wanted to make science fiction, science non-fiction.

notes:
Key notes. Make sure you actually join a club this time. "Near future peers" refers to people that are in a similar position as you, just one year ahead. This gives you the chance to learn at a level very close to yourself and helps build credibility when you're interested in leadership later down the line. Taking classes is NOT always worth it. For me, I took too many classes and didn't feel like I learned anything because I was learning with shortcuts. If I could go back in time, I would audit those classes which is basically just attending lectures without the work. Also try to start applying for internships. You're not expected to get one, but it's good practice to pitch yourself.

notes:
But then came the burn out. I can get emotionally over-invested at times. In this case, I had the burden of leadership of the hackathon, a year-long effort with over $12000 invested and 150 people involved, then leadership of the organizing body, to manage another 30 members, on top of increasingly difficult classes and the return to in-person learning. My final quarter was quite stressful and I didn't have a good outlet, so my mental health reflected in my grades. I failed a class. Got dumped in my first relationship. Then got hit by a car.

# Build / Lead
| Do                                          | Why                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Look for leadership / senior roles in clubs | Distributed bus factor |
| Learn to cook / eat healthy                 | Maslow's Hierarchy     |
| Find friends with hobbies                   | Accountability + Learn |
|    Internship hunt early                       |   Gives you time to adjust  |
|    Use your calendar                     |          Meetings + Timebox + Regular work sessions               |

notes:
at this stage, make sure you start progressing through clubs. It's no longer good enough to just be a member of everything. Become a leader or responsible for something in your club and start teaching or sharing your lessons. All senior members of any field, needs to learn how to share their wealth of knowledge. Next make sure you learn how to cook and take care of yourself. Hunt for internships early. Then make sure you make good use of your calendar. Here's what a week of my time looked like.

notes:
Eventually I would start auditing classes that I could no longer feasibly take. And that led to some incredible opportunities. Led to a tutoring position with the visual arts students and eventually to a spot in a VR research lab. The members of the lab, I actually had met through my club involvement before hand. Because I knew that I wanted to do work in CSEd and I had done work in CSEd, I had the opportunity to keep doing more work in this field.

# Teach and socialize

| Do                                                | Why                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Professor OH for not-school work                  | They're cool people + opportunities |
| Audit classes                                     | VR + Tutor positions                |
| Learn to socialize                                | Opens more opportunities            |
| Don't wait until you're ready to do what you want | Experience begets more experience                                    |

notes:
at this point in time, you're on your way out. Make sure you share your lessons to give back to the people that brought you to where you are today. If you don't need to take the class, consider just auditing them. But most importantly, learn how to socialize. The earlier you do it, the better. But by a senior, this is where you can actually start taking advantage of opportunities by learning how to talk to people. Go to office hours for not-school, go to talk about projects you're interested in. For feedback. For opinions. I had more opportunities back-loaded in my time at UCSD. Maybe it's because I only learned how to talk to people in my final year. Maybe it's because by this stage, I'd been doing what I want to specialize in that I had more opportunities in CSEd.

notes: you can't get help if you haven't started yet. all the advice from near-peers and office hours and advisors can't help if you don't know where you're stuck. To help with this, I recommend you block out like 5 minutes after assignments are revealed to come up with a strategy on how to solve the problem. This allows you to engage your diffused thinking.

  Prototyping is cheaper
 
notes: in order for you to start often, you've got to come up with new ideas, otherwise you're "repeating often" and that's a recipe for insanity. This subtly encourages innovation. Just pick one thing you want to improve at a time. Don't do a dozen things until you can scale up to a dozen things.

notes: it emphasizes the idea of starting, not stopping. Failure is a consequence of the journey. For every start, there should be some lesson learned regardless of if you failed. That's how we build up to becoming better engineers.
